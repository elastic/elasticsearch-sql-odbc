Once the application is launched, you'll first need to create a _New Dossier_:

To import into the _New Dossier_ just opened, press on the _New Data_ button in the _DATASETS_ column:

[[apps_microstrat_newdata]]
.New Data

This will open a new window that allows to choose the source to load data from. Click on the _Databases_ icon:

[[apps_microstrat_databases]]
.Access data from Tables

In the newly opened _Import from Table - Select_ window, click on the *+* button to the right of _DATA SOURCES_ item:

[[apps_microstrat_newds]]
.New Data Source

In the _Data Source_ window, tick the radio button for _DSN Data Sources_. In the _DSN_ drop-down box, choose the name of the DSN that you
have previously configured. For the _Version_, chose _Generic DBMS_.

Input a user name and password in the provided fields.
Note that the application requires them irrespective of the fact that they might already be part of the previously configured DSN and the
new input will take precedence over those.

Finally, give a name to the application-specific data source you're just configuring:

[[apps_microstrat_dsn]]
.Data Source

.Select Import Options

The data source you've named two steps before will now be listed in the _DATA SOURCES_ column. Clickin on its name will trigger the
application to query the {es} instance configured in the DSN and list the tables available within:
