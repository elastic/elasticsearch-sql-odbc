== ODBC client applications

experimental[]

Thanks to a standardized API, a broad range of third-party ODBC-enabled applications can access {es} using {product}.
This section will collect alphabetically an increasing list of such applications along with the configuration steps that need to be taken
within them.

* <<sql-odbc-applications-excel, Microsoft Excel>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-powerbi, Microsoft Power BI Desktop>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-ps1, Microsoft PowerShell>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-microstrat, MicroStrategy Desktop>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-qlik, Qlik Sense Desktop>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-tableau, Tableau Desktop>>

NOTE: Each application has its own requirements and licensing; these are outside the scope of this documentation which only covers the
configuration aspect of integration with {es-sql}.

WARNING: The support for applications implementing the ODBC 2.x standard and prior is currently limited.
